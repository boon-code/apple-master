In this thrilling survival game, your objective is to catch as many ripe,
juicy apples as you can while avoiding the dreaded worm-infested ones. Armed
with only a basket, you must rely on your reflexes and keen eye to snatch the
perfect apples.

As you navigate through the orchard, the challenge intensifies with each
passing moment. The apples rain down faster, testing your agility and
precision.
But beware! Amongst the bounty of delicious fruits, lurk the rotten apples,
infested with worms ready to spoil your harvest.

With each successful catch, you earn points and advance through the levels.
But be cautious, even the slightest mistake could result in a wormy disaster!
Are you ready to take on the ultimate test of survival and become the Apple
Master of all time.
